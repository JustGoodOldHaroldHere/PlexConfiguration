# PlexConfiguration
Guidance on building a Ubuntu Plex server. Just click on a link and follow along. 

The purpose of this github is to provide step by step configuration for a complete media server setup that covers grounds for most users out there. I will provide all my information sources at the bottom of each guide i make. I wish to add i did not create any of the applications in these guides i am simply providing a centralised location for instructions on getting them up and running

# Localised Server 
[Plex (Obviously)](/Plex.md), 
[Radarr](/Radarr.md), 
[Sonarr](Sonarr.md), 
[Transmission](/Transmission.md), 
[Tor](/Tor.md) , 
[Jackett](/Jackett.md), 
[Nginx & Certbot](/NginxAndCertbot.md) ,
[General Configuration](/general.md)

# Cloud Server
All of the above with [RClone](/Rclone.md) and/or [PlexDrive](/PlexDrive.md) using Google Drive as Storage. 

# Assumptions
You have obtained your own Cloud/Local server and installed Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. If you are using a cloud based solution with Google Drive, you have purchased your Google Drive subscription.

# Additional
Not all of the information is linked here so feel free to take a look around for certain configuration files. Where you find them on here is the layout they are on my Plex setup

This GitHub is not fully finished yet so if you spot any errors or spelling mistakes let me know (I can imagine their is many)

If you are willing to spare 2 minutes. Please do share this guide
