Guidance on building a Ubuntu Plex server. Just click on a link follow along

# Localised Server 
[Plex (Obviously)](http://https://github.com/JustGoodOldHaroldHere/PlexConfiguration/blob/master/Plex%20Installation.md "Plex (Obviously)"), 
[Radarr](http://https://github.com/JustGoodOldHaroldHere/PlexConfiguration/blob/master/Radarr%20Installation.md "Radarr"), 
[Sonarr](http://https://github.com/JustGoodOldHaroldHere/PlexConfiguration/blob/master/Sonarr%20Installation.md "Sonarr"), 
[Transmission](http://https://github.com/JustGoodOldHaroldHere/PlexConfiguration/blob/master/Transmission%20Installation.md "Transmission"), 
[Tor](http://https://github.com/JustGoodOldHaroldHere/PlexConfiguration/blob/master/Tor%20Installation.md "Tor"), 
[Jackett](http://https://github.com/JustGoodOldHaroldHere/PlexConfiguration/blob/master/Jackett%20Installation.md "Jackett"), 
[Nginx & Certbot](http://https://github.com/JustGoodOldHaroldHere/PlexConfiguration/blob/master/Nginx%20And%20Certbot.md "Nginx & Certbot")

# Cloud Server
All of the above with [RClone](http://https://github.com/JustGoodOldHaroldHere/PlexConfiguration/blob/master/Rclone%20Installation.md "RClone") and/or [PlexDrive](http://https://github.com/JustGoodOldHaroldHere/PlexConfiguration/blob/master/PlexDrive%20Installation.md "PlexDrive") using Google Drive as Storage. 

# Assumptions
You have obtained your own Cloud/Local server and installed Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. If you are using a cloud based solution with Google Drive, you have purchased your Google Drive subscription.

# Additional
Not all of the information is linked here so feel free to take a look around for certain configuration files. Where you find them on here is the layout they are on my Plex setup
